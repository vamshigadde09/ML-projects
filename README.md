# ML-projects
# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health-related features. The model is trained on a sample dataset and serves as a demonstration of the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset containing information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and diabetes outcomes. The dataset is available in the [sample_dataset.csv]([sample_dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset)) file.

## Machine Learning Model

The project uses scikit-learn to implement machine learning models. Specifically, it includes:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Additionally, it demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and cross-validation for model evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diabetes-prediction`
3. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for specific tasks.

## Usage

- [Notebook](notebooks/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
- [Scripts](scripts/): Python scripts for specific tasks or components of the project.

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test dataset using Logistic Regression. Detailed results and evaluation metrics can be found in the [Results](results/) directory.
